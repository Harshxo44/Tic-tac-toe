# Tic-tac-toe
Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple yet interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my coding project, I developed this game to improve my front-end development skills and gain hands-on experience with JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
