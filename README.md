# Tic-tac-toe
Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple yet interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my coding project, I developed this game to improve my front-end development skills and gain hands-on experience with JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
 
 
 
 
 About the Project



Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of the same symbols in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonallyâ€”before the opponent.

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
This project helped me explore:

How to structure an interactive web page.
Implementing game logic using JavaScript.
Using event listeners to make the game dynamic.
Applying CSS to enhance UI design and responsiveness.
